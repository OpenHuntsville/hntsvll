# Bugs
1. Error checking on events to make sure that in the edit page a user has the correct credentials to have edit rights. I think currently someone could edit any event by manipulating the url
2. ~~Don't show past events~~
3. Make it so that when an Admin creates an event or a group, it is automatically approved

# Enhancements
1. ~~Group workflows for group creation~~
2. Email all admins when their event has been approved
3. ~~Refine the event approval process. Make the dashboard page the same as the manage page but different for admins~~
4. Custom_url for groups, just like people
5. Need to add an /events/past route to show past events

# Potential Enhancements
1. Fix the breadcrumbs for events so instead of showing Home / People / Tyler Hughes / Events it says Home / Events
