1. Error checking on events to make sure that in the edit page a user has the correct credentials to have edit rights. I think currently someone could edit any event by manipulating the url
2. Group workflows for group creation
3. Email all admins when their event has been approved
4. Don't show past events
5. ~~Refine the approval process. Make the dashboard page the same as the manage page but different for admins~~
6. Fix the breadcrumbs for events so instead of showing Home / People / Tyler Hughes / Events it says Home / Events
7. Make it so that when an Admin creates an event or a group, it is automatically approved
